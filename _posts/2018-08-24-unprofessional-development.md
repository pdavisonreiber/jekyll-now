I’m very excited to announce that my former colleague [Luke Pearce](https://twitter.com/lukepearce85) and I have started a new podcast called [**Unprofessional Development**](http://unprofessionaldevelopment.net). The tag line is _sometimes teaching, always learning_, and that’s exactly what we’ll be discussing. We’re both maths teachers who want to continue to develop our knowledge and skills in teaching, but we both also have a passion for learning things outside of our jobs. 

With the end of the summer holidays looming, Episode 1 is entitled _Back to School_, and in that we discuss how best to teach the first lessons of the year. We hope that you enjoy it, and that you’ll subscribe to hear future episodes. You can find us in [Apple Podcasts](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/unprofessional-development/id1404364974?mt=2), [Overcast](https://overcast.fm/+NsiCVs1Sk), and [lots of other places](http://unprofessionaldevelopment.net). 

We also have a new twitter account [@unprofdev](https://twitter.com/unprofdev), where you can send us feedback on the show and hear about new episodes.
