[Drafts](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/drafts/id1236254471?uo=4) recently introduced custom themes, so I thought I'd have a go at creating one myself. I've always loved the aesthetic of my task manager [Things](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/things-3-for-ipad/id904244226?uo=4), so I've tried to emulate its dark mode colour scheme as closely as possible.[^1]

If you're interested in learning more about making Themes for Drafts, I can recommend Tim Nahumck's [blog post](https://nahumck.me/drafts-26-the-customization-update/) on the topic. Following his example, I also made use of [Jayson](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/jayson/id1447750768?uo=4) and [Pastel](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/pastel/id413897608?uo=4) to help with the process. He was also on the [most recent episode](https://www.relay.fm/automators/73) of the Automators podcast speaking about the recent updates to Drafts, so that's worth checking out too. Finally, there's the [documentation](https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/extending/development/theme-format#scopes) on the Drafts website which goes into the nitty gritty. 

You can download my [Things Dark theme](https://actions.getdrafts.com/t/1kL) from the Drafts Directory.
